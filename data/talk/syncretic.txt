21 while at a residency at the Banff New Media Institute
22 	-- SS2 --
23 .. it was an ideal project to start off with, as the software element was not
24 actually very difficult, but the logistical setup made it seem more impressive!

30 VJ Apps
31 I started making VJ applications with Pure Data, then quickly moved to Processing
32 (I love Pd, but it wasn't very good for video/generative visuals at that point…)
33 Processing was ideally suited for making generative visuals, basic particle systems, etc.
34 	-- SS1
35 Making these kind of applications allowed me to code small, focused programs
36 but forced me to think about program architecture, interaction, and performance issues,
37 and helped me understand classes, arrays, and the larger features of Java...
38 (but also forced me into learning openFrameworks / C++ pretty quickly! )

40 Original GCode
41 A tool designed for rapid 2D fabrication of graffiti stencils,
42 built as part of Graffiti Research Lab Germany for our exhibition at Transmediale 11,
43 it uses a webcam and custom capture frame to trace a 'tag' and export it to GCode…

50 SonicDrift
51 A locative media framework for the Android OS
52 Made during the M.A.R.I.N. residency in Norway, Sweden, Lithuania
53 Records sounds on the Android hardware, saves them with the current GPS,
54 and plays them back when that GPS point is re-reached…

60 PWN THE WALL
61 An extension of 'bombIR' - shared across multiple screens / locations
62 Uses Graffiti Markup Language to transfer data to/from a Server
63 and re-parses the data upon receipt, leaving the heavy lifting to the local machine...
