051 KWILT 
052 This was initially inspired by Mennonite quilts that were hanging in Kitchener City Hall
053 Some backstory about how this project was initiated… 
054 Christie Micro Tiles
055 Made in Processing, as this was the easiest / most familiar to address variable windows and screen positions
056 Started with HYPE framework, moved to a custom class after issues with OOP ability of HYPE
057 Will be creating a Library for this

061 BERLIN STEP SEQUENCER 
062 also made on Christie Micro Tiles, also made with Processing, with the addition of Pure Data
063 Kitchener used to be named Berlin up until WWI… I used to live in Berlin. I know there are over 50 ‘Berlins’ in the US… 
064 The idea was to pull/create a dataset from the various cities and see what type of composition it made - an experiment in disparity and difference
065 And of course… I just really wanted to make a step sequencer with the tiles :D
066 and techno/electronic music is a big part of Berlin’s (DE) identity…
067 The video you see is on a Windows port, so the ordering of the screens is off, but its kind of nice.

071 IX SYMPOSIUM 
072 Part of the reason that I wanted to go out east was to attend the IX Symposium at the SAT in Montreal.
073 This was timed right before Mutek and Elektra, and concurrent with sound+vision and the BIAN.
074 Speakers included Jeffrey Shaw, Miller Puckette, Greg Hermanovic, Naut Human, Barry Threw, Vade, Quentin Bleton, and a bunch of academics you wouldn’t recognize
075 There were dome performances by Joanie Lemercier, Mary Franck, 1024 Architecture, Nohista, and RFID
076 The first day was a lot of researchers with really large budgets…
077 The second day got into tools, which was my jam…
078 The third day i was drinking with Barry and Vade and Miller the whole time and don’t remember much else…

081 SECOND STORY 
082 This is an AR app that was built for The Only Animal. Funded by a BC Innovations grant.
083 The idea was to make a camera tracking app that would trigger site-specific stories.
084 I decided to use the Vuforia framework by Qualcomm, after talking to Julapy about it. 
085 Designed by Jess Butler, and thanks to Martin Schueller for the help on the Android version.
085 Specs: needed to be cross-platform (Android/iOS), and be able to trigger planar content, not just models.
086 Challenges: Asynchronous content installation. Tracking shots / development cycle. Designing for both platforms.
087 Live on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.

091 GENERATE
092 As some of you know, I work for Hybridity on Generate, which is a OpenGL-based filter app for A/V creation.
093 There are a few other people from the team in the room tonight…
094 We’ve had an exciting last few months, with projection-based gigs in London, Seattle, Portland, and New York, as well as one coming up for Art Basel in Miami.
095 … as well as being featured in exhibitions at Emily Carr and Science World.
095 We have version 0.4.5 live on Android now, with a video implementation coming soon.
096 We are launching the pro feature pack on iOS next week, with the ability to do unlimited recording, a/v output, and some other awesome features.
097 We are also building an officially sanctioned expansion application for the VJ app VDMX.

101 HEALTH DESIGN LAB
102 A lot of my work for Emily Carr involved doing high level UX and code prototyping for the Health Design Lab, a research institute at ECUAD.

131 YES NOVA 
132 Now, you’ve seen a pretty large variety of projects that I’ve been messing with the last few months - and there’s more where that came from… 
132 As well, a number of them are in varying states of being finished… largely because of one thing.
134 Nova.
135 Nova is my daughter, who some of you have met, and the love of my life. But I don’t share photos of her online.
136 Never.
137 Unless I make the platform on which to show it.
138 Which I have (WIP).
